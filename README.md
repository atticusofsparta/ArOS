# ArOS - Arweave operating system

ArOS is a linux based operating system with a built in ArSeeding node, and utilities for interacting with the arweave blockchain. It runs its node by default, automatically updating its data to the blockchain and actiing as a direct interface to it. When you save a file on ArOS, you save a file to arweave. It is the ultimate interface into permanent data.

## Flavors
ArOS is available for desktop, mobile and server applications.

## Applications

ArOS enables a new form of permaweb application to be installed, much like linux has the apt repository, ArOS has the weap repository. Builders can upload ArOS applications to arweave tagged for the weap repository and their apps can be added to a whitelist by the ArOS dao. This lets ArOS reference a curated list of apps or explore other software as the user likes. Installing non curated weap apps is dangerous for most users, so this will be an advanced process on purpose and not activated by default.

## Customizable network DNS

ArOS has access to the devices built in DNS registry and can modify it to the users wishes. When the user decides to "save" a permaweb dapp. For example, ArweaveApps (https://mtfvznw2pwxykoicvxpoe7ao5rp4nhaueueux2bbe4klxankdhra.arweave.net/ZMtcttp9r4U5Aq3e4nwO7F_GnBQlCUvoIScUu4GqGeI/) can be downloaded and saved on the users gateway, and accessed via the custom DNS entry by all the users connected ArOS devices at ArweaveApps.io.

## Personal and private gateway

ArOS provides a gateway for users to connect their other ArOS powered devices to using their local wired/wireless mesh network. Users can have a home server and connect with their laptop or mobile device, and access all their information, or share with their nieghbors, effectively bring arweave off-grid.

Private gateways are for users to upload sensitive data thru their own gateway from other devices. Its an ecrypted channel to directly access and transmit private information.
